## General info
Implemented Rendezvous and docking trajectory optimization problem
based on the paper using convex optimization techniques:    

Probabilistic Trajectory Optimization Under Uncertain Path Constraints for Close Proximity Operations

This system assumes a circular orbit of the target, as do the linear dynamics in this frame. In the Clohessy–Wiltshire–Hill (CWH), the relative translational motion of the chaser spacecraft with respect to the target can be defined by the CWH equations as

where m is the mass of the chaser spacecraft; Fx, Fy and Fz are thrust forces applied by the chaser spacecraft; n = sqrt( μ∕r3) is the mean motion of the target satellite; and r0 is the radius of the target’s
circular orbit.
&nbsp;    
The Clohessy–Wiltshire–Hill (CWH) frame is centered on the target spacecraft, with the i^ direction pointing radially outward from the Earth; the j^ direction pointing in the intrack, orbital velocity direction of the target satellite; and the k^ direction pointing in the crosstrack direction, out of the orbital plane, to complete the orthogonal set. This system assumes a circular orbit of the target, as do the linear dynamics in this frame.
&nbsp;    
Additionally, because the dynamics will eventually need to be implemented in discrete time for the trajectory optimization process, the discrete-time version of these
dynamics is x(k+1) =  Ad @ x(k) + Bd @ u(k)   - (3)
where k is the current time step, T is the discretization time or time
between steps k and k + 1.    
&nbsp;    
The rendezvous trajectory problem can be formulated as a prioritized optimization problem as
follows.

### Input Data    
Chaser (SDX01) and Target (SDX02) state vectors are derived using the TLEs.

&nbsp;    
#### Remember this is a target centered coordinate frame and the chaser state vectors should be in relative to target

### Convex Optimization    

Python library CVXPY [ https://www.cvxpy.org/ ] used for optimization,       
Used CLARABEL solver for this problem.
